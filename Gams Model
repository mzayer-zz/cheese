N_exitsting load-points /n1*n11/

N_future   future load-points /n12*n24/

L_existing  existing-Lines /l1*l9/

L_candidates   candidate-Lines /l10*l38/  ;


* x: planning variable

* X: variable indicating the presence of element in year t

* Lf: Loss factor (for converting max Loss into average loss)

* OC(sub): operation cost of a substation


equations



obj_func =e= Inv_Cost + Opr_Cost + Loss_Cost + LOLE_Cost

Inv_Cost =e= X(sub)*IC(sub) + x(plan_line)*X(line)*IC(line)

Opr_Cost =e= Ssmax(sub)*OC(sub)

Loss_Cost =e= X(line)*Lf*Ploss*Cost(loss)



* S : Incidence matrix
Pin + Pprd =e= Pdemand + Pout (KCL for all nodes)

Qin + Qprd =e= Qdemand + Qout (KCL for all nodes)

Vn' - Vn = (Rl*PFl + Xl*QFl)/V1 (KVL for all lines (l) from node n' to node n) 


PFmin =g= PFl =l= PFmax

QFmin =g= QFl =l= QFmax


CAPsub =l= CAPmax (capacity of substation)

0.95 =g= Vn =l= 1.05

ICinv =l= ICmax (budget limitation)


Xline_mod + Xline_rep =l= 1 (each line either gets replaced or modified. not both)

Xsub_mod + Xsub_rep =l= 1 (the same as above for substations)


Yak + Yfi + Yre =l= Nt (number of branches in work must <= the number of nodes to avoid loops.

* Y is a variable that shows whether the line is being operated. it is bound by Y<=X to 
ensure not using it when it's not planned.
